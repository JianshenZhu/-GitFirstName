#include<stdio.h>
#include<malloc.h>
void main()
{
    char *a;
    a = (char *)malloc(10);//In this case the GDB was showing that it has an invalid printer in the program, I found that there is a <malloc.h> included in the head so I realized that the free function is combined with malloc function and is used in heap not stack, free function is used to deallocate the memory once you donâ€™t want it anymore. So I defined "a" by malloc function and then free the memory. 
    int i;
    char *b = "hello";
    while (i<6){
    *(a+i)=*(b+i);
     i++;
    }   
    printf("%s",a);

     free( a );
}
